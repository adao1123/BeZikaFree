    <string name="symptoms_title">What are the symptoms of Zika?</string>
    <string name="symptoms_text">The Zika virus commonly causes a mild flu-like illness that might include fever, headache, joint and or muscle pain, conjunctivitis (“pink eye”) and sometimes a body rash.\n\nMost people infected with Zika virus won’t have symptoms. For this reason, many people might not realize they have been infected. It is estimated that only one out of five infected people will have symptoms. The most common symptoms of Zika are fever, rash, joint pain, or conjunctivitis (red eyes). Other common symptoms include muscle pain and headache.\n\nThe illness is usually mild. Symptoms begin 3 to 7 days after being infected and can last for several days to a week. People usually don’t get sick enough to go to the hospital, and they very rarely die of Zika.\n\nZika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for about a week but it can be found longer in some people. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.\n\nSee your doctor or other healthcare provider if you are pregnant and develop a fever, rash, joint pain, or red eyes within 2 weeks after traveling to a place where Zika has been reported. Be sure to tell your doctor or other healthcare provider where you traveled.</string>
    <string name="overview_title">What is Zika?</string>
    <string name="overview_text">The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne illness, meaning people can get the virus by being bitten by an infected mosquito. Zika virus is related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile Virus. It was first identified in 1947. In 2013 there were outbreaks of illness from Zika virus in several Pacific islands. More recently, the virus has been reported in many Central and South American countries. Beginning in late 2015, cases of Zika virus have been reported in some U.S. states. These are people who were infected while traveling to these countries.</string>
    <string name="transmission_mosquito_title">Through Mosquito Bites</string>
    <string name="transmission_mosquito_text">Zika virus is transmitted to people primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito (A. aegypti and A. albopictus). These are the same mosquitoes that spread dengue and chikungunya viruses. \n\nThese mosquitoes typically lay eggs in and near standing water in things like buckets, bowls, animal dishes, flower pots and vases. They prefer to bite people, and live indoors and outdoors near people. \n\nMosquitoes become infected when they feed on a person already infected with the virus. Infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other people through bites.</string>
    <string name="transmission_mother_title">From Mother to Child</string>
    <string name="transmission_mother_text">A pregnant woman can pass Zika virus to her fetus during pregnancy. Zika is a cause of microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects. We are studying the full range of other potential health problems that Zika virus infection during pregnancy may cause. \n\nA pregnant woman already infected with Zika virus can pass the virus to her fetus during the pregnancy or around the time of birth. \n\nTo date, there are no reports of infants getting Zika virus through breastfeeding. Because of the benefits of breastfeeding, mothers are encouraged to breastfeed even in areas where Zika virus is found.</string>
    <string name="transmission_transfusion_title">Through Blood Transfusion</string>
    <string name="transmission_transfusion_text">As of February, 1, 2016, there have not been any confirmed blood transfusion transmission cases in the United States. \n\nThere have been multiple reports of blood transfusion transmission cases in Brazil. These reports are currently being investigated. \n\nDuring the French Polynesian outbreak, 2.8% of blood donors tested positive for Zika and in previous outbreaks, the virus has been found in blood donors.</string>
    <string name="transmission_sex_title">Through Sexual Contact</string>
    <string name="transmission_sex_text">Zika virus can be spread by a man to his sex partners. \n\nIn known cases of sexual transmission, the men developed Zika virus symptoms. From these cases, we know the virus can be spread when the man has symptoms, before symptoms start and after symptoms resolve. \n\nIn one case, the virus was spread a few days before symptoms developed. \n\nThe virus is present in semen longer than in blood.</string>
    <string name="transmission_father_title">What if the father of the baby is infected with the Zika virus or has been in an area where Zika is active?</string>
    <string name="transmission_father_text">Zika virus can be found in semen and sexual transmission of the virus has been reported. We do not know how often Zika infection can be found in semen or how long the virus can be present in semen. Consistent and regular condom use is recommended for women if a man has a current diagnosis of Zika infection, a man has symptoms of Zika, or a man has recently been in a place where there is known Zika transmission, even if he has had no symptoms. A man who has returned from an area of active Zika transmission but has not had any symptoms should consider using a condom for 28 days after his return to prevent the chance of sexual transmission to his non-pregnant partner.</string>
    <string name="effects_risks_title">Background Risks</string>
    <string name="effects_risks_text">In every pregnancy a woman starts out with a 3-5% chance of having a baby with a birth defect. This is called her background risk. This sheet talks about whether exposure to the Zika virus may increase the risk for birth defects over that background risk. This information should not take the place of medical care and advice from your health care provider.</string>
    <string name="effects_breastfeeding_title">Breastfeeding with Zika</string>
    <string name="effects_breastfeeding_text">The Brazilian Ministry of Health and the CDC state that with our current understanding, breastfeeding should not be interrupted. At this time there is no information on possible effects to the baby in a breastfeeding mother who has the Zika virus. Be sure to talk to your health care provider about all your choices for breastfeeding.</string>
    <string name="effects_pregnancy_title">Can Zika Virus Affect my Pregnancy?</string>
    <string name="effects_pregnancy_text">In April 2016, the CDC announced that there is now enough evidence to conclude that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly (small head and brain) and other severe fetal brain defects. Other abnormalities are also associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Mothers of these babies described rash and flu-like illnesses during their pregnancies and some have tested positive for the Zika virus. Research is continuing to determine the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in babies whose mothers had the Zika virus in pregnancy. \n\n Pregnant women can be infected with Zika virus in any trimester (4,7,8). The incidence of Zika virus infection in pregnant women is not currently known, and data on pregnant women infected with Zika virus are limited. No evidence exists to suggest that pregnant women are more susceptible to Zika virus infection or experience more severe disease during pregnancy. \n\n Maternal-fetal transmission of Zika virus has been documented throughout pregnancy (4,7,8). Although Zika virus RNA has been detected in the pathologic specimens of fetal losses (4), it is not known if Zika virus caused the fetal losses. Zika virus infections have been confirmed in infants with microcephaly (4), and in the current outbreak in Brazil, a marked increase in the number of infants born with microcephaly has been reported (9). However, it is not known how many of the microcephaly cases are associated with Zika virus infection. Studies are under way to investigate the association of Zika virus infection and microcephaly, including the role of other contributory factors (e.g., prior or concurrent infection with other organisms, nutrition, and environment). The full spectrum of outcomes that might be associated with Zika virus infections during pregnancy is unknown and requires further investigation.</string>
    <string name="effects_pregnancy2_title">Before I got pregnant I was in a country with active Zika. What if I had Zika then, even without symptoms? Is there a chance of a problem for the baby?</string>
    <string name="effects_pregnancy2_text">Zika virus usually remains in the blood of an infected person for a few days to a week. The virus will not cause infection in a baby that is conceived after the virus is cleared from the mother’s blood. If you conceived very shortly before or after returning from an area with active Zika, you should speak to your health care provider, regardless of symptoms. There is currently no evidence that Zika virus infection increases the chance of birth defects in future pregnancies. Again, the chance of a problem for the baby when the mother has Zika infection in her pregnancy is not well understood.</string>
    <string name="effects_microcephaly_title">Facts about Microcephaly</string>
    <string name="effects_microcephaly_text">Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that might not have developed properly.\n\n Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected. During pregnancy, a baby’s head grows because the baby’s brain grows. Microcephaly can occur because a baby’s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy or has stopped growing after birth, which results in a smaller head size. Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other major birth defects.\n\n Severe microcephaly is a more serious, extreme form of this condition where a baby’s head is much smaller than expected. Severe microcephaly can result because a baby’s brain has not developed properly during pregnancy, or the brain started to develop correctly and then was damaged at some point during pregnancy.\n\n Babies with microcephaly can have a range of other problems, depending on how severe their microcephaly is. Microcephaly has been linked with the following problems:\n\n \t\t• Seizures \n \t\t• Developmental delay, such as problems with speech or other developmental milestones (like sitting, standing, and walking) \n \t\t• Intellectual disability (decreased ability to learn and function in daily life) \n \t\t• Problems with movement and balance \n \t\t• Feeding problems, such as difficulty swallowing \n \t\t• Hearing loss \n \t\t• Vision problems \n\n These problems can range from mild to severe and are often lifelong. Because the baby’s brain is small and underdeveloped, babies with severe microcephaly can have more of these problems, or have more difficulty with them, than babies with milder microcephaly. Severe microcephaly also can be life-threatening. Because it is difficult to predict at birth what problems a baby will have from microcephaly, babies with microcephaly often need close follow-up through regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor their growth and development.</string>
    <string name="prevention_title">Prevention</string>
    <string name="prevention_text">Prevention is the best approach for protection. That includes using an EPA approved insect repellent, wearing protective clothing (such as long sleeves and long pants and/or clothing treated with permethrin), and removing standing water where mosquitoes live and breed. When possible, air-conditioning or screens should be used to keep mosquitoes out of the home. More information is available on The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) webpage Zika Virus Prevention. MotherToBaby fact sheets are available for the insect repellent DEET and information about the insecticide permethrin is included on our Pesticides and Pregnancy fact sheet.</string>
    <string name="prevention_preventBites_title">Steps to Prevent Zika - Prevent Bites</string>
    <string name="prevention_preventBites_text">When in areas with Zika and other diseases spread by mosquitoes, take the following steps:\n\n \t\t • Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. \n \t\t • Stay in places with air conditioning and window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside. \n \t\t • Take steps to control mosquitoes inside and outside your home. \n \t\t • Sleep under a mosquito bed net if you are overseas or outside and are not able to protect yourself from mosquito bites.\n \t\t • Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. Choosing an EPA-registered repellent ensures the EPA has evaluated the product for effectiveness. When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for pregnant and breast-feeding women.\n \t\t •Treat clothing and gear with permethrin or purchase permethrin-treated items. \n\n Even if they do not feel sick, travelers returning to the United States from an area with Zika should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for 3 weeks so they do not spread Zika to mosquitoes that could spread the virus to other people.</string>
    <string name="prevention_control_outsideHome_title">Control Mosquitoes Outside Home</string>
    <string name="prevention_control_outsideHome_text">• Install or repair and use window and door screens. Do not leave doors propped open.\n\n • Once a week, empty and scrub, turn over, cover, or throw out any items that hold water like tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flowerpot saucers, or trash containers. Mosquitoes lay eggs near water. \n\n • Tightly cover water storage containers (buckets, cisterns, rain barrels) so that mosquitoes cannot get inside to lay eggs. \n\n • For containers without lids, use wire mesh with holes smaller than an adult mosquito.\n\n • Use larvicides to treat large containers of water that will not be used for drinking and cannot be covered or dumped out. \n\n • Use an outdoor flying insect spray where mosquitoes rest. Mosquitoes rest in dark, humid areas like under patio furniture, or under the carport or garage. When using insecticides, always follow label instructions. \n\n • If you have a septic tank, repair cracks or gaps. Cover open vent or plumbing pipes. Use wire mesh with holes smaller than an adult mosquito.</string>
    <string name="prevention_control_insideHome_title">Control Mosquitoes Inside Home</string>
    <string name="prevention_control_insideHome_text">• Keep windows and doors shut and use air conditioning when possible.\n\n • Keep mosquitoes from laying eggs inside your home. Once a week, empty and scrub, turn over, cover, or throw out any items that hold water like vases and flowerpot saucers.\n\n • Kill mosquitoes inside your home. Use an indoor flying insect fogger* or indoor insect spray* to kill mosquitoes and treat areas where they rest. These products work immediately, but may need to be reapplied. Always follow label directions. Only using insecticide will not keep your home free of mosquitoes.\n\n • Mosquitoes rest in dark, humid places like under the sink, in closets, under furniture, or in the laundry room.\n\n • Use an indoor fogger* or indoor insect spray* to reach and treat areas were mosquitos rest inside the home.</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_protectOthers_title">Protect Others</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_protectOthers_text">• Zika virus can be spread during sex by a man infected with Zika to his sex partners.\n • To help prevent spreading Zika from sex, you can use condoms, correctly from start to finish, every time you have sex. This includes vaginal, anal, and oral (mouth-to-penis) sex. Condoms also prevent HIV and other STDs. Not having sex is the only way to be sure that someone does not get sexually transmitted Zika virus.</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_condomDoDont_title">The Right Way to Use a Male Condom</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_condomDoDont_text">• DO use a condom every time you have sex.\n • DO put on a condom before having sex.\n • DO read the package and check the expiration date.\n • DO make sure there are no tears or defects.\n • DO store condoms in a cool, dry place.\n • DO use latex or polyurethane condoms.\n • DO use water or silicone-based lubricant to prevent breakage.\n • DO remember that condoms come in many sizes and thicknesses, so find a brand that works best for you and your partner.\n\n • DON’T store condoms in a car or keep them in your wallet.\n • DON’T use nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide), as this can cause irritation.\n • DON’T use oil-based products like baby oil, lotion, petroleum jelly, or cooking oil because they will cause the condom to break.\n • DON’T use more than one condom at a time.\n • DON’T reuse a condom.\n • DON’T flush condoms as they may clog the toilet.</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_condomUse_title">How To Put On and Take Off a Male Condom</string>
    <string name="prevention_safeSex_condomUse_text">• Carefully open and remove condom from wrapper.\n • Place condom on the head of the erect, hard penis. If uncircumcised, pull back the foreskin first. \n • Pinch air out of the tip of the condom.\n • Unroll condom all the way down the penis.\n • After sex but before pulling out, hold the condom at the base and withdraw the penis.\n • Carefully remove the condom and throw it in the trash.</string>
